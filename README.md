# ErlogTris Y2K
this is basically a joke gone too far or something

So this dude one day made this kanji tetris game but it was bad at the tetris part
and when we told him [all](http://www.twitch.tv/toastermage/c/6304119) the
[problems](http://www.twitch.tv/flamerokz/c/6296638) with it he got all angsty and
renamed it to Jake and Flamerokz New Age Tetris 2K6.

And thus, ErlogTris Y2k.

So in an attempt to keep anyone from actually compiling this to make fun of how
badly it works, I choose a language that no one will have a compiler for: D

But since people have complained, I`ll at least explain what you need:
* A D compiler (I use ldc, but dmd or gcc should be fine)
* [dub](http://code.dlang.org/download)

so all you really need to do is run `dub build` and it should grab whatever
dependencies it needs to run.
