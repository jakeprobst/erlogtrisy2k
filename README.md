this is basically a joke gone too far or something

So in an attempt to keep anyone from actually compiling this to make fun of how
badly it works, I choose a language that no one actually will have a compiler
for: D

But since people have complained, I`ll at least explain what you need:
* A D compiler (I use ldc, but dmd or gcc should be fine)
* [dub](http://code.dlang.org/download)

so all you really need to do is run `dub build` and it should grab whatever
dependancies it needs to run.
